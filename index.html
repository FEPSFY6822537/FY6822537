         Fear was an emotion instilled into allied soldiers due to the creations from German tank engineers in World War 2. 
         But which of the heavy tanks were theoretically the best? The Panzer IV, Tiger and Panther were three key German heavy tanks in World War 2. 
         From an engineering perspective, the Panther Ausf. A is empirically the best. 
         The Panzer IV’s best aspect being its engine, however the Panther outperforms it in every aspect- horsepower, fuel capacity, maximum speed and cruising range. 
         The Tiger’s best aspect being armour and armament, but the Panther has a more uniform amour (with a more suited combat weight) and the Panther’s cannon has the longest barrel,
         capable of firing the highest calibre shells- making it the most effective cannon that the Germans produced. 
         Comparing every characteristic of each tank proves that the Panther is better at everything and is the best heavy tank overall.

         There is nothing that would strike immediate fear and anxiety into a war hardened soldier quite like seeing a tank emerging from the enemy line and start to rain heavy shells
         onto your position whilst being almost impenetrable to everything in your arsenal. This concept was rooted deeply in the ‘German Armour Doctrine’-
         “These tactics represented a philosophical approach by the German army intended to break the deadlock of trench warfare” (DiNardo, 1996).
         This article sets to explore, from a theoretical perspective, just how dominant these tanks should and would have been on the battlefield of World War 2-
         structurally dissecting three key German ‘heavy tanks’, one by one- coming to a theoretical conclusion regarding which tank was the ‘best’ overall.

         Different Panzerkampfwagen (translated to ‘Armoured Fighting Vehicle’) are envisioned, built and operated with different capabilities and purposes-
         ‘heavy tanks’ were made to be unstoppable fortresses on wheels. The three tanks I have picked from Nazi Germany are the best
         examples of the aforementioned ‘heavy tank’ (regarding large combat weights). I will decide my conclusion based on the empirical data points 
         (such as armour thickness, armament specifications; maximum speed). Of course, the ‘heavy tanks’ are made for a specific purpose,
         but it is still important if the tanks can represent a strong range of characteristics- many of these covered, explained from 
         ‘27 Parts of Tanks and Their Uses [With Diagram, Pictures & Names]’ (Engineeringlearn, 2023).

     <p class="ex1">
       <pre style="font-family:Bahnschrift;">
         The longest serving Nazi tank, the Panzerkampfwagen IV (AKA: Panzer IV) was first produced in 1937(3) with the Ausfuhrung (Varient) A (AKA: Ausf. A).
         Being the earliest ‘heavy tank’, the Germans developed this specific tank the most over the years of the Nazi reign-
         from the Ausf. A to the Ausf. J. The Ausf. J is the most refined variant of the Panzer IV and is almost incomparable to the Ausf. A,
         given the rapid advancement in technology over the war. The Ausf. A weighs a measly 17,300 kg(3) compared to the Ausf. J’s 25,000 kg(3).
         The Ausf. A is shielded by a uniform 1.45 cm(3)armour thickness all over, however the Ausf. J holds a more appropriate 8 cm frontal, 3 cm side and 2 cm rear covering(3).
         The Ausf. J takes 40 calibre rounds whereas Ausf. A takes 37 calibre shells(3)- higher calibre rounds mean better amour penetration- additionally,
         the Ausf. J houses the longer barrel (L/48 = 48 x 75 = 3.6 metre barrel) and a subsequent longer effective range. Other factors-
         such as Ausf. J doubling Ausf. A’s driving range, the 8 kph increased top speed (30 to 38)(3) and the 680 Litre maximum fuel capacity (apposed to the 453 Litre from Ausf. A)(3)-
         add evidence that the Germans evolved the Panzer IV to a commendable definition of what they envisioned to be a ‘heavy tank’.
