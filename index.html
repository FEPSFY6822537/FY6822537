         Fear was an emotion instilled into allied soldiers due to the creations from German tank engineers in World War 2. 
         But which of the heavy tanks were theoretically the best? The Panzer IV, Tiger and Panther were three key German heavy tanks in World War 2. 
         From an engineering perspective, the Panther Ausf. A is empirically the best. 
         The Panzer IV’s best aspect being its engine, however the Panther outperforms it in every aspect- horsepower, fuel capacity, maximum speed and cruising range. 
         The Tiger’s best aspect being armour and armament, but the Panther has a more uniform amour (with a more suited combat weight) and the Panther’s cannon has the longest barrel,
         capable of firing the highest calibre shells- making it the most effective cannon that the Germans produced. 
         Comparing every characteristic of each tank proves that the Panther is better at everything and is the best heavy tank overall.

         There is nothing that would strike immediate fear and anxiety into a war hardened soldier quite like seeing a tank emerging from the enemy line and start to rain heavy shells
         onto your position whilst being almost impenetrable to everything in your arsenal. This concept was rooted deeply in the ‘German Armour Doctrine’-
         “These tactics represented a philosophical approach by the German army intended to break the deadlock of trench warfare” (DiNardo, 1996).
         This article sets to explore, from a theoretical perspective, just how dominant these tanks should and would have been on the battlefield of World War 2-
         structurally dissecting three key German ‘heavy tanks’, one by one- coming to a theoretical conclusion regarding which tank was the ‘best’ overall.
