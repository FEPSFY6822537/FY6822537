         Fear was an emotion instilled into allied soldiers due to the creations from German tank engineers in World War 2. 
         But which of the heavy tanks were theoretically the best? The Panzer IV, Tiger and Panther were three key German heavy tanks in World War 2. 
         From an engineering perspective, the Panther Ausf. A is empirically the best. 
         The Panzer IV’s best aspect being its engine, however the Panther outperforms it in every aspect- horsepower, fuel capacity, maximum speed and cruising range. 
         The Tiger’s best aspect being armour and armament, but the Panther has a more uniform amour (with a more suited combat weight) and the Panther’s cannon has the longest barrel,
         capable of firing the highest calibre shells- making it the most effective cannon that the Germans produced. 
         Comparing every characteristic of each tank proves that the Panther is better at everything and is the best heavy tank overall.

         There is nothing that would strike immediate fear and anxiety into a war hardened soldier quite like seeing a tank emerging from the enemy line and start to rain heavy shells
         onto your position whilst being almost impenetrable to everything in your arsenal. This concept was rooted deeply in the ‘German Armour Doctrine’-
         “These tactics represented a philosophical approach by the German army intended to break the deadlock of trench warfare” (DiNardo, 1996).
         This article sets to explore, from a theoretical perspective, just how dominant these tanks should and would have been on the battlefield of World War 2-
         structurally dissecting three key German ‘heavy tanks’, one by one- coming to a theoretical conclusion regarding which tank was the ‘best’ overall.

         Different Panzerkampfwagen (translated to ‘Armoured Fighting Vehicle’) are envisioned, built and operated with different capabilities and purposes-
         ‘heavy tanks’ were made to be unstoppable fortresses on wheels. The three tanks I have picked from Nazi Germany are the best
         examples of the aforementioned ‘heavy tank’ (regarding large combat weights). I will decide my conclusion based on the empirical data points 
         (such as armour thickness, armament specifications; maximum speed). Of course, the ‘heavy tanks’ are made for a specific purpose,
         but it is still important if the tanks can represent a strong range of characteristics- many of these covered, explained from 
         ‘27 Parts of Tanks and Their Uses [With Diagram, Pictures & Names]’ (Engineeringlearn, 2023).

    <h3 id="#PANZERKAMPFWAGEN : IV" style="font-family:Courier New;">PANZERKAMPFWAGEN : IV</h3>
     <p class="ex1">
       <pre style="font-family:Bahnschrift;">
         The longest serving Nazi tank, the Panzerkampfwagen IV (AKA: Panzer IV) was first produced in 1937(3) with the Ausfuhrung (Varient) A (AKA: Ausf. A).
         Being the earliest ‘heavy tank’, the Germans developed this specific tank the most over the years of the Nazi reign-
         from the Ausf. A to the Ausf. J. The Ausf. J is the most refined variant of the Panzer IV and is almost incomparable to the Ausf. A,
         given the rapid advancement in technology over the war. The Ausf. A weighs a measly 17,300 kg(3) compared to the Ausf. J’s 25,000 kg(3).
         The Ausf. A is shielded by a uniform 1.45 cm(3)armour thickness all over, however the Ausf. J holds a more appropriate 8 cm frontal, 3 cm side and 2 cm rear covering(3).
         The Ausf. J takes 40 calibre rounds whereas Ausf. A takes 37 calibre shells(3)- higher calibre rounds mean better amour penetration- additionally,
         the Ausf. J houses the longer barrel (L/48 = 48 x 75 = 3.6 metre barrel) and a subsequent longer effective range. Other factors-
         such as Ausf. J doubling Ausf. A’s driving range, the 8 kph increased top speed (30 to 38)(3) and the 680 Litre maximum fuel capacity (apposed to the 453 Litre from Ausf. A)(3)-
         add evidence that the Germans evolved the Panzer IV to a commendable definition of what they envisioned to be a ‘heavy tank’.

    <h3 id="#PANZERKAMPFWAGEN : TIGER" style="font-family:Courier New;">PANZERKAMPFWAGEN : TIGER</h3>
     <p class="ex1">
       <pre style="font-family:Bahnschrift;">
         The Panzerkampfwagen Tiger (AKA: Tiger) was the only ‘heavy tank’ variant- the other being classed as a ‘super heavy tank’, named the ‘King Tiger’.
         The Tiger was first produced in May 1943(4), roughly 2 years before the end of World War 2- meaning that it did not have the time to evolve beyond its first variant.
         The tank boasts an impressive 45 kph(4) maximum speed alongside a massive 670 Litre(4) maximum fuel capacity- caveated by its disappointing 120 km(4) maximum cruising range.
         This vehicle was not pulling any punches with its 8.8 cm Kw.K.36 L/56 cannon(4)- the only heavy tank to utilise the 8.8 cm ammunition,
         these shells were the largest in length but smallest in calibre (diameter), with 92(4) of them being able to be stored on board at a time.
         The longer barrel length means that the effective range of the shells was larger. Lastly, the armour was drastically upgraded, with 10 cm frontal and 8 cm side and rear(4)-
         a large step up from the legacy of the Panzer IV, the Tiger had a near 55,000 kg(4) combat weight-
         “The general logic of anti-tank defence is that the best defence against a tank is another tank.” (DiNardo, 1996)-
         Germany clearly wanting the Tiger to utterly outperform enemy tanks in every aspect.

     <p class="ex1">
       <pre style="font-family:Bahnschrift;">
         The Panzerkampfwagen Panther (AKA: Panther) is the final ‘heavy tank’ in contention. Unlike the Tiger, the Panther had multiple variants- all produced in 1943(5),
         its initial variant being the Ausf. D then the Ausf. A and finally the Ausf. G. They all carried the same armour thickness, had the same length and similar height.
         Additionally, they also all used the same 7.5 cm Kw.K.42 L/70 cannon(5)- the pinnacle of German tank armament. This cannon is comprised of the longest barrel (largest effective range)
         alongside the devastating 42 calibre, 7.5 cm shells (all 79 to 82 of them)(5). Panthers also pose a more uniform armour of 8 cm all round(5). Given its period of insurgency into the war,
         it isn’t surprising that the fuel capacity is as large as 720 to 730 Litres(5). Even though horsepower varies across models (from 650 to 700 to 600)(5), the cruising range is the same across all.
         Finally, only the weaker 600 hp Ausf. G achieves 45 kph(5), the other two achieving 55 kph(5). From the three variants, the Ausf. A theoretically is the best.

    <h3 id="#CONCLUSION" style="font-family:Courier New;">CONCLUSION</h3>
     <p class="ex1">
       <pre style="font-family:Bahnschrift;">
         Between the Panzer IV Ausf. J, Tiger and Panther Ausf. A, there is a clear third place- that being the Panzer IV. Unfortunately, given that it evolved from the early stages of heavy tank experimentalising,
         the template was too light and too small to have any significant weight or armament implemented into later variants. 
         
         The Tiger and Panther are similar in many regards- both having respectable armour thicknesses and powerful engines with large fuel capacities, capable of high top speeds.
         However, the Tiger seems to be an ‘overcompensation’ from the Panzer IV- being much too heavy and paying for it with its limited 120 km maximum cruising range(4).
         Alongside the Panther being a great all rounder with no fatal flaws, the shortcoming from the Tiger makes the Panther the ‘best’ heavy tank from Germany in World War 2.
