         Fear was an emotion instilled into allied soldiers due to the creations from German tank engineers in World War 2. 
         But which of the heavy tanks were theoretically the best? The Panzer IV, Tiger and Panther were three key German heavy tanks in World War 2. 
         From an engineering perspective, the Panther Ausf. A is empirically the best. 
         The Panzer IV’s best aspect being its engine, however the Panther outperforms it in every aspect- horsepower, fuel capacity, maximum speed and cruising range. 
         The Tiger’s best aspect being armour and armament, but the Panther has a more uniform amour (with a more suited combat weight) and the Panther’s cannon has the longest barrel,
         capable of firing the highest calibre shells- making it the most effective cannon that the Germans produced. 
         Comparing every characteristic of each tank proves that the Panther is better at everything and is the best heavy tank overall.
